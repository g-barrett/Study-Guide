         <li>All of these lists were made using HTML!</li>
         <li>An element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag</li>

          <li>External CSS style sheets are coded in a separate file, making design changes easier. it can be linked with a "link" element in the HTML "head" element</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
