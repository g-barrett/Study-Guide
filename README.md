# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide created for boot camp students. I wanted an easy to access all-in-one-place website for students to study the content they learned. It contains notes on HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, simply review the sections of notes. You can get a suggestion for what to study by using the Chrome DevTools in your browser. Press Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to open the console either below or on the side of your browser. Locate the "Console" tab at the top; you will see a list of topics along with a suggestion on what to study.
